Dear user!

CafeGuide is an application that will help you to choose where to have a meal.
In order to use the app please take three things into consideration:

1. Before using the app please download the corresponding database and attach it
to your MSSQL Server. The DBis stored in the repository: https://github.com/sabitova/CafeGuide

2. Please make sure that the connection string in the MainWindow.xaml.cs class
contains the correct name of your local server.

3. The app is designed to be working with repositories as well as with databases.
The functionality for repositories may be tested by commenting/uncommenting 
highlighted lines in the StartWindow.xaml.cs class.

Good luck!
